# Me
Hello, I am a 16 years old french developer who love games and make games. I started programming since I was 11 years old. My first game and project is on Scratch but quickly I switched to Python and C# for my classical projects and GDScript in Godot for my games. I already have a very solid base in Python and my C# code is not perfect but I am working on it.
