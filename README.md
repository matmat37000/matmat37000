# Me
Hi, I'm a 17 years old french developer who love games and make games. I've started programming since I was 11 years old. My first game and project was on Scratch but quickly I switched to Python and C# for my projects in general and GDScript with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for my games. I already have a very solid base in Python and started to switch from GDScript to C#. <!-- I'm currently working on a game based on the [Street SuS](https://www.instagram.com/street_sus__off/) story -> [Cheese On Baguette Gamme Studio](https://github.com/CheeseOnBaguetteGameStudio). -->
